## Reference Platform & Applications Working Group

**Coordinator:** Yadunund Vijay (Intrinsic)

## Overview

This group makes the initiative's work tangible by integrating all
technologies into a physical platform with accessible examples and
community-facing activities.

## Scope

### Reference Hardware Platform (T(AI)rtle Bot 5)

Build and maintain a low-cost, open-source robot that serves as the
primary integration and demonstration target for the entire initiative. The
platform includes simulation demonstrations for accessibility.

### Showcase Applications & MCP Introspection

Develop easy-to-use, Python-centric examples on the platform that also
demonstrate advanced features like **MCP introspection** for runtime
system analysis and debugging.

### Community Engagement & Outreach

Use the reference platform and its applications as a tool to grow the user
base through hackathons, tutorials, and community events.

### Simulation Resources

Provide examples using teleoperation and deployment with various
simulators including O3DE, Mujoco, and Isaac Sim. Note: RL training in
simulation is not prioritized as people favor lock-step approaches.

## Roadmap

### Long-term Vision

Create a low-cost, open-source reference platform (T(AI)rtle Bot 5) that
serves as the primary integration and demonstration target for the entire
Physical AI initiative. The platform will enable researchers and
developers to:

- Test and validate Physical AI standards and interfaces
- Develop and share applications accessible to the broader community
- Engage through hackathons, tutorials, and community events
- Access simulation resources for accessibility and development without hardware

### Current Priorities

- **Platform Design & Specifications:** Define hardware requirements and
  component selection for T(AI)rtle Bot 5
- **Simulation Environment:** Develop simulation demonstrations for
  accessibility and testing
- **Example Applications:** Create Python-centric examples demonstrating
  Physical AI capabilities
- **MCP Introspection Tools:** Implement runtime system analysis and
  debugging capabilities
- **Multi-Simulator Support:** Establish examples using O3DE, Mujoco, and
  Isaac Sim for teleoperation and deployment

### Upcoming Milestones

- **Q1 2025:** Complete T(AI)rtle Bot 5 hardware design and initial prototype
- **Q2 2025:** Release simulation environment with basic teleoperation examples
- **Q2 2025:** Publish first set of showcase applications with MCP introspection
- **Q3 2025:** Launch community engagement program with tutorials and documentation
- **Q4 2025:** Host first hackathon event with reference platform
