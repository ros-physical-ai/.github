## Working Groups

The Physical AI SIG is organized into five working groups, each focused on a critical layer of the stack.

## [Standardized Interfaces & Messages](standardized-interfaces)

**Coordinator:** Michel Hidalgo (Ekumen)

Defines the common language and contracts for the ecosystem, ensuring all components are interoperable and reusable.

## [Data Collection Pipeline](data-collection)

**Coordinator:** Anh Vu Vu (Huawei)

Builds the workflow of collecting data, logging under constraints, and inspecting and visualizing logged data for curation.

## [Training & Execution Pipeline](training-execution)

**Coordinator:** Michael Gentner (BMW)

Builds the end-to-end software workflow, enabling developers to take a trained policy and run it efficiently and robustly on a robot.

## [Reference Platform & Applications](reference-platform)

**Coordinator:** Yadunund Vijay (Intrinsic)

Makes the initiative's work tangible by integrating all technologies into a physical platform with accessible examples and community-facing activities.

## [Embodied Agentic AI](embodied-agentic-ai)

**Coordinator:** Adam Dabrowski (Robotec.ai)

Develops standards, best practices and reference applications for flexible skill composition, where reasoning models orchestrate state-of-the-art packages and learned policies through tool use.
