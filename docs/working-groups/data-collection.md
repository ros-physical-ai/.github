## Data Collection Pipeline Working Group

**Coordinator:** Anh Vu Vu (Huawei)

## Overview

This group builds the workflow of collecting data, logging under constraints (poor network conditions, etc.), and inspecting and visualizing logged data for curation.

## Scope

### Introspection & Visualization

Provide tools for visualizing, validating, and curating (e.g. clipping) collected data.
Examples include functionality provided by Rerun and Foxglove.

### Data Storing & Conversion

Export and convert to relevant data formats (e.g. rosbag2 → lerobot).

### Teleoperation

Support for standard teleoperation devices, standard interfaces for joint and Cartesian jogging.
Includes basic tools for retargeting with devices like MOCAP4ROS2, HTC Vive, and Meta Quest.

### Annotation

Annotating sub-tasks, adding prompts and other metadata to episodes.
