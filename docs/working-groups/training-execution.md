## Training & Execution Pipeline Working Group

**Coordinator:** Michael Gentner (BMW)

## Overview

This group builds the end-to-end software workflow, enabling developers to
take a trained policy and run it efficiently and robustly on a robot.

## Scope

### End-to-End Policy Deployment

Create a seamless flow to convert trained policies into performant ROS
graphs, including critical steps like real-time data synchronization for
inference.

### Real-Time Execution & Performance

Develop and standardize core components, such as real-time capable
executors, to ensure that deployed policies can meet strict performance
guarantees.

### Pipeline Tooling & Expansion

Improve the developer experience with simplified installation and testing
tools while extending the pipeline to support advanced paradigms like
Reinforcement Learning.
