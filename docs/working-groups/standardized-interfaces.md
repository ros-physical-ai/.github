## Standardized Interfaces & Messages Working Group

**Coordinator:** Michel Hidalgo (Ekumen)

## Overview

This group defines the common language and contracts for the ecosystem, ensuring all components are interoperable and reusable.

## Scope

### Standard Robot Interfaces

Define the fundamental APIs for interacting with robot hardware, including low-level sensors and actuators as well as high-level motion planning and control.

### AI Data Representation

Standardize the full lifecycle of ML data, defining the message format (`rcl::Tensor`) for real-time communication and the file format for offline data collection.

### Model Deployment APIs

Specify the standard interfaces for deploying and interacting with a trained policy, defining how the system requests inference from a running AI model.
