## What is the Physical AI SIG?

The Physical AI SIG is a subproject of OSRA TGC focused on providing
declarative standards and tooling to simplify training, deploying, and
operating Physical AI models across diverse robot embodiments.

We leverage ROS's proven strengths—standardized interfaces, hardware
abstraction, and mature ecosystem—to bridge the gap between AI research and
real-world deployment. By establishing common conventions for describing
robotic embodiments and their interfaces, we enable:

- **Data Collection** across diverse hardware platforms
- **Model Training** with standardized data formats
- **Deployment** of AI models to production robots

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** Define standardizations to represent and interface with robots
for training, simulating, and deploying physical AI models across various
embodiments.

**Vision:** Enable ROS to serve as both a platform for data collection and a
framework for the commercial deployment of Physical AI models.

## Working Groups

We're organized into five working groups, each focused on a critical layer
of the stack. [View detailed working group pages →](docs/working-groups/)

| Working Group | Focus | Coordinator |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **[Standardized Interfaces & Messages](docs/working-groups/standardized-interfaces)** | Common language and contracts for ecosystem interoperability | Michel Hidalgo (Ekumen) |
| **[Data Collection Pipeline](docs/working-groups/data-collection)** | Tools and workflows for data collection, logging, and curation | Anh Vu Vu (Huawei) |
| **[Training & Execution Pipeline](docs/working-groups/training-execution)** | End-to-end software workflow for policy deployment | Michael Gentner (BMW) |
| **[Reference Platform & Applications](docs/working-groups/reference-platform)** | T(AI)rtle Bot 5 platform and showcase applications | Yadunund Vijay (Intrinsic) |
| **[Embodied Agentic AI](docs/working-groups/embodied-agentic-ai)** | Standards for flexible skill composition with reasoning models | Adam Dabrowski (Robotec.ai) |

## Community & Contributing

The Physical AI SIG is developed in the open and welcomes contributions from
the community. We ask that participants commit to making regular open-source
contributions to items outlined in the SIG's roadmap.
